##
# A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning algorithm for a
# feedforward neural network.  Gradients are calculated using backpropagation.
# Note that I have focused on making the code simple, easily readable, and
# easily modifiable.  It is not optimized, and omits many desirable features.
